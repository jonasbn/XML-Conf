README of XML::Conf

This is originally the work of Ariel Brosh, a member of Israel.pm and author of several contributions to CPAN. He has unfortunately passed away and have left behind several Perl modules where this is just one of them.

I volunteered to contribute further to the development of the module, but it is still kept under the name of Ariel Brosh.

I have added everything to the Copenhagen Perl Mongers CVS server, check http://cvs.legart.dk/cvsweb.cgi/modules/XML/Conf/
